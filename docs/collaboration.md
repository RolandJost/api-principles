## API Consumers provide interface tests
`Should`

APIs allow and engage consumers to provide *Consumer Driven Contract Tests*.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }
*{coming soon}*

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- API consumers take on responsibility of the changeability and operational stability of APIs
- Early E2E testing of interfaces between teams
- Early discussions between teams often lead to better collaboration, stability and quality
- Consumer are motivated to contribute to APIs (CDC is a an important entry-level step for that path to an *InnerSource* collaboration)

## Consumers contribute to APIs

Teams of APIs are open to contributions of other teams by following the [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org) culture. API Consumers contribute the following types of code:
- `Must` Documentation
- `Must` Consumer Driven Contract Tests
- `Must` Bug-Reports and Feature-Requests
- `Should` Bugfixes in the API
- `Should` Simple API Features
- `May` Complex Features
- `May` Refactorings

#### Example
{: .no_toc }
*{coming soon}*

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- APIs will eventually become "consumer driven" (see also: the API Maturity model)
- The Design of an API is more consumer oriented and therefore provides a better developer usability and more functionality. This leads to lower costs through higher reuse.
- Better speed of API Consumer teams and much less waiting times of consumers for a feature. Solves the *backlog hibernation*.
