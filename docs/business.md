## An API is owned by a business product owner
Severity: `Must`

- Responsibility of an API is explicitly defined.
- The Business Product Owner acts "consumer driven". Means, he focuses on sorving it's API consumers in a best possible way.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }
*{coming soon}*

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- It assures that there is always a team which is resposible for the maintenance and further development of the API
- It assures that there are appropriate financial resources and a constant invest in the API maturity
- Prioritization is owned by one person
- Decisions are owned by one person, but supported by the team

## An API has a support channel
Severity: `Must`

An API must have a responsive support channel which responds on bugs, questions & contributions within a working day. Usually we use eMail or a Chat (e.g. Teams) as channels. It is also a good practice to have a published and accessible FAQ.
- Process: *TBD*...
- DevOps operation processes as a possible approach, but patterns not yet documented

#### Example
{: .no_toc }
*{coming soon}*

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- Shorter Mean Time To Repair
- Lower costs, due to higher speed through a well known and efficient support for API consumers
