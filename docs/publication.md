## APIs are findable `Must`
Severity: `Must`
``MUST``
```MUST```
`Requirement Level: MUST`


APIs are published on a API Repository and findable through a single index. Currently there are the following Plattforms for API publication:
- API Management
- OpenData
- G#
- *(SAP API Management)*

APIs need to be ordered and grouped by business capabilities.
#### Example
{: .no_toc }
[SBB Developer Portal](https://developer.sbb.ch)

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- Better transparency and findability leads to a higher reuse which again leads to lower redundancy and costs.
- Better findability and documentation leads to a higher collaboration between API consumer and provider.
- Better stability and efficiency of consumers due to better documentation

## Centralized API documentation in english
Severity: `Must`

Contains: Business Capabilities, Context, details and technical specification. There are also examples / the possibility to *Try-It-Out*. Cookbooks or even client public libraries and code templates help developers consume APIs more efficiently.

*{coming soon}*

#### Rational
{: .no_toc }
- Lower costs through higher reuse and better collaboration
- Better Speed trough increased understandability
- Enables new business models due to a global understandable Repository of APIs
- Compatible with strategic *shoring* of business capabilities

## APIs as a Service
Severity: `Must`

Consumers can consume APIs without the need of human interaction. This is important for early prototyping and fast rampup. Usually teams will nevertheless collaborate and talk together before production readyness.

APIs provide subscription plans and there is an automated sign-up process.

#### Example:
{: .no_toc }
*{coming soon}*

#### Rational:
{: .no_toc }
- Automated transparency of interfaces between teams
- Higher speed and efficiency when implementing new interfaces (highly reduced [Cost of Delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_delay)
